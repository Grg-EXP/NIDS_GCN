# M-2022-Andreoli-Gregorio-Thesis-Design and Development of an Adaptive Security System for IoT

The IoT threat landscape is changing at an increasing rate, and failure to mitigate such threats results in economic loss for victims as well as infrastructure costs.The IoT  and  IIoTnetworks  are  one  of  the  most  critical  parts  of  a  manufacturing company's  infrastructure  from  a  cybersecurity  standpoint,  primarily  because  the Internet of Things is notoriously insecure, but not because the technology to build or protect it is immature, but because industrial IoT security suffers from a lack of willpower.This  thesis  describes  a  new detection engine modulefor  a Network Intrusion  Detection  System  (NIDS)  based  on  Graph  Convolutional  Networks (GCNs),a Dirichlet distribution asloss functionand an explainer to producefurther analysis.  GCNs  are  a  newer  subfield  of  deep  neural  networks  that  can  take advantage of the inherent structure of graph-based data.Data for NIDS training and evaluation are often represented as flow records, which can naturally be expressed in  graph  format.  In this  paper,  a  GCN  techniqueis  presented for  capturing topological  information  for  network  intrusion  detection  in  IoT  networks. To  the best of myknowledge, my approach is the first, practical, and researched strategy using GCNs for network intrusion detection in IoT with a Dirichlet distribution as a loss function.
